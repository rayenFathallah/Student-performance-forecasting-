The project aims to help educators, administrators, and parents make informed decisions by predicting the academic performance of students based on their historical data.The model is tested and evaluated on different classification models: logistic regression, and the different ensemble methods as well as a combination between them using voting classifier. The choice of these algorithms is that they are easier to interpret which is the main aim of the project. Additionally the project Employed Local and global interpretation techniques with Python to conduct in-depth analysis of the inter-relations among various educational factors for
performance prediction.
The repository contains the necessary code and data required to reproduce the project's results, as well as a detailed documentation outlining the methodology and findings.
