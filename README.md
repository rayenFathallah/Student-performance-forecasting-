This GitHub repository contains code and resources for forecasting and analyzing the performance of students. The project aims to help educators, administrators, and parents make informed decisions by predicting the academic performance of students based on their historical data.. 
The model is tested and evaluated on different classification models:  logistic regression, and the different ensamble methods as well as a combination between them using voting classifier. The choice of these algorithms is that they are are easier to interpret which is the main aim of the project. 
Additionally, the project provides solutions on how to improve student performance based on the analysis. The repository contains the necessary code and data required to reproduce the project's results, as well as a detailed documentation outlining the methodology and findings.
